The following Atmel 7 Project contains code for inverting matrices and timing the processes. 

The earlier version of the code (Gauss-Jordan without partial pivoting was working for matrices upto 4*4) The newer one (Gauss-Jordan with partial pivoting) isn't even working for 3*3 matrices. (However, the main coe does work on visual studio)
